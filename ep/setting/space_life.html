		<img src="meal_sts127.jpg">
		<p>A consensus "up" has to be decided if you want to all dine facing the same rotational orientation: that is, if all the diners want to look "rightside-up" while they dine with each other. Maybe some scum like to fuck with newcomers by eating/conversing upside-down?</p>
